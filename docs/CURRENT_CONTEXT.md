## üéØ Active Development

### Current Sprint/Focus
**Working On**: Documentation Strategy System  
**Session Started**: 2025-08-17  
**Priority**: Setting up development workflow management

### Recent Changes (Last 3 Sessions)
- **2025-08-17**: Created documentation strategy system (DEVELOPMENT_STRATEGY.md, FEATURE_IMPACT_MATRIX.md, etc.)
- **Previous**: Implemented price caching system (cache.ts, prices.ts)
- **Previous**: Upgraded to Tailwind CSS v4 with PostCSS

### Files Recently Modified
```
docs/DEVELOPMENT_STRATEGY.md - NEW: Living documentation system
docs/FEATURE_IMPACT_MATRIX.md - NEW: Feature dependency tracking
docs/CHANGE_IMPACT_CHECKLIST.md - NEW: Impact analysis checklist
docs/templates/IMPLEMENTATION_REVIEW_TEMPLATE.md - NEW: Review template
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & TODOs

### Immediate Attention Needed
- [ ] shadcn/ui components not implemented (using manual Tailwind components)
- [ ] No test coverage across the application
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode warnings in some files

### Deferred Work
- [ ] DeFi positions component needs protocol integration
- [ ] Transaction history needs indexer setup
- [ ] Performance chart needs historical data source

## üîÑ Current System State

### What's Working
- ‚úÖ Wallet connection (RainbowKit + Wagmi)
- ‚úÖ Theme system (7 themes, dynamic switching)
- ‚úÖ Price fetching with 5-minute cache
- ‚úÖ Basic portfolio overview

### What's Partially Working
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Token balances (mock data for some tokens)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Portfolio calculations (needs real DeFi data)

### What's Not Implemented
- ‚ùå Real DeFi protocol integration
- ‚ùå Transaction history
- ‚ùå Performance analytics
- ‚ùå Multi-chain support (only Avalanche C-Chain)

## üéÆ Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start dev server with Turbopack

# Validation (Run these before marking task complete!)
npm run lint         # Check code style
npm run format:check # Check formatting (Prettier)
npm run build        # Production build test
# Note: No typecheck script available

# Formatting
npm run format       # Auto-format code with Prettier

# Testing pages
/test-wallet         # Wallet connection testing
/test-prices         # Price service testing
/test-cache          # Cache functionality testing
```

## üí° Context for Next Session

### If continuing current work
1. Finish implementing the documentation strategy
2. Consider adding shadcn/ui components
3. Start writing tests for critical features

### If starting new feature
1. Read FEATURE_IMPACT_MATRIX.md first
2. Use CHANGE_IMPACT_CHECKLIST.md before starting
3. Update this file immediately after changes

### Watch out for
- Theme system affects ALL components (test theme switches)
- Wallet disconnection should clear portfolio data
- Cache has 5-minute TTL for prices
- Some components use mock data (marked with TODO comments)

## üìä Project Health Metrics

- **Technical Debt Level**: Medium (missing tests, some hardcoded values)
- **Documentation Status**: Good (improving with new strategy)
- **Code Consistency**: Good (follows patterns, needs shadcn/ui)
- **Performance**: Good (bundle <300KB, fast renders)
- **Type Safety**: Excellent (TypeScript throughout)

## üö¶ Next Priority Decisions

**High Priority**:
1. Implement shadcn/ui for consistent components
2. Add basic test coverage
3. Complete DeFi integrations

**Medium Priority**:
1. Transaction history implementation
2. Performance chart with real data
3. Error boundary improvements

**Low Priority**:
1. Additional themes
2. Advanced analytics
3. Multi-chain expansion
