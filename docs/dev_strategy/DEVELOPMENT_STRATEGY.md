# Development Strategy & Documentation Management System

## üéØ Problem Statement

During active development with Claude, documentation and implementation often diverge because:
- PRDs evolve as features are built
- New features impact existing code in unexpected ways
- Extended development sessions can lead to confusion about current state
- Hard to track what's been implemented vs. what's planned

## üìã Solution: Living Documentation System

### 1. **CLAUDE.md Enhancement**

Update CLAUDE.md with a "CURRENT_CONTEXT" section that includes:

```markdown
## CURRENT_CONTEXT
Last Updated: [Date]

### Active Development
- **Current Feature**: [What's being worked on]
- **Related Files**: [List of files being modified]
- **Dependencies**: [What this feature affects]
- **Status**: [In Progress/Testing/Complete]

### Recent Changes
- [Date]: Added price caching system (affects: portfolio components)
- [Date]: Implemented theme system (affects: all UI components)

### Known Issues
- [ ] Component X needs update after Y feature
- [ ] Test coverage for Z feature

### Next Steps
1. [Immediate next task]
2. [Following task]
```

### 2. **Feature Impact Matrix**

Create a matrix tracking how features interconnect:

```markdown
## Feature Impact Matrix

| Feature | Affects | Depends On | Test Files | Status |
|---------|---------|------------|------------|--------|
| Wallet Connection | Header, Portfolio | Web3Provider | wallet.test.ts | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Price Caching | PortfolioOverview, DeFiPositions | Cache Service | cache.test.ts | üöß In Progress |
| Theme System | All UI Components | ThemeStore | theme.test.ts | ‚úÖ Complete |
```

### 3. **Change Propagation Checklist**

Before implementing any feature, Claude should:

```markdown
## Pre-Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Search for all files importing the module being changed
- [ ] Check for dependent components using grep/search
- [ ] Review state management impacts
- [ ] Check theme system compatibility
- [ ] Verify TypeScript interfaces alignment

## Post-Implementation Checklist  
- [ ] Run lint and typecheck
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md CURRENT_CONTEXT
- [ ] Update Feature Impact Matrix
- [ ] Document any new dependencies
- [ ] Note any deferred updates needed
```

### 4. **Session Handoff Template**

For when you take breaks or switch contexts:

```markdown
## Session Handoff - [Date]

### What Was Done
- Implemented X feature in Y files
- Modified Z component to support new feature

### Current State
- App is: [Working/Partially Broken/Needs Fix]
- Last command run: [npm run dev]
- Current errors: [None/List errors]

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Fix TypeScript error in file.tsx:45
2. Update tests for new feature
3. Add proper error handling

### Watch Out For
- Component A might need update after this change
- Performance impact on B needs testing
- Style conflicts with theme C
```

### 5. **Implementation Review Process**

After each major feature:

```markdown
## Implementation Review - [Feature Name]

### Planned vs Actual
| Aspect | Planned | Actual | Deviation Reason |
|--------|---------|--------|------------------|
| Approach | [Original] | [What was done] | [Why changed] |
| Files | [Expected] | [Actually modified] | [Additional needs] |

### Ripple Effects Discovered
- Unexpected: Had to update X because of Y
- Deferred: Component Z needs update but postponed

### Documentation Updates Needed
- [ ] Update PRD section X
- [ ] Update technical spec for Y
- [ ] Add to CLAUDE.md context
```

## üöÄ Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Initialize System (Immediate)
1. Create DEVELOPMENT_STRATEGY.md (this file)
2. Add CURRENT_CONTEXT section to CLAUDE.md
3. Create initial Feature Impact Matrix

### Phase 2: Establish Workflow (Next Session)
1. Start each session by reading CURRENT_CONTEXT
2. Update context after each significant change
3. Use checklist before major implementations

### Phase 3: Maintain Momentum
1. Quick status updates every 3-4 file changes
2. Full review after each feature completion
3. Session handoff whenever stopping work

## üìù Quick Reference Commands

Add these to CLAUDE.md for Claude to use:

```bash
# Check what depends on a component
grep -r "ComponentName" src/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts"

# Find all imports of a module  
grep -r "from.*moduleName" src/

# Check for TODO comments
grep -r "TODO\|FIXME" src/

# Run full validation
npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run build
```

## üîÑ Living Documentation Principles

1. **Documentation as Code**: Treat docs like code - version controlled, reviewed, tested
2. **Just-In-Time Updates**: Update docs immediately when changes occur
3. **Single Source of Truth**: CLAUDE.md is the primary context source
4. **Fail-Safe Approach**: When unsure, document the uncertainty
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start simple, add detail as needed

## üéØ Success Metrics

- Reduced "context loss" during long sessions
- Fewer breaking changes from feature additions
- Clear understanding of system state at any point
- Faster onboarding to continue work

## üö® Red Flags to Watch For

Signs the documentation is falling behind:
- Can't remember what a recent change was for
- Unsure which components need updates
- Conflicts between different features
- Tests failing unexpectedly
- Style/theme inconsistencies appearing

When you see these signs, STOP and update documentation first.

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Use TodoWrite Tool**: Have Claude maintain a todo list for complex features
2. **Commit Messages as Docs**: Write detailed commit messages that explain "why"
3. **Comment Complex Changes**: Add inline comments for non-obvious modifications
4. **Screenshot States**: Save screenshots of UI states before major changes
5. **Version Milestones**: Tag git commits at stable points for easy rollback

## üîß Maintenance Schedule

- **Every Feature**: Update Feature Impact Matrix
- **Every Session**: Update CURRENT_CONTEXT in CLAUDE.md
- **Weekly**: Review and clean up accumulated TODOs
- **Per Milestone**: Full documentation audit and cleanup

This strategy ensures you and Claude stay synchronized, reducing confusion and improving development velocity. The key is making documentation updates part of the development flow, not an afterthought.
